Sorting algorithm game-type for entertainment.  Anyone who knows how to make games with graphics can contact me at : granis.k[at]pinewood-school.gr
<br />
# TRANSLATIONS ARE NEEDED : <br />
Read at the bottom of the page.
## This game is going to be distributed to elementary schools so no swearing or exciplit images. <br />
<br />
 If anyone does not obey these rules they will be reported to the GitHub community and kicked out of the repository.

## Installation<br />
To install the application you need to run : 

### Linux & Mac OS (X) :<br />


Run 'make' and 'make install'. <br />

#### Then you can modify and add anything to the game that results. <br />
<br />
Windows : <br />

<br />
There is no installer for windows for now but maybe someone can port it to windows after the game and the code is complete.<br />

# Making The Game<br />
If you are a game developer please contact me at the mail given above. You might ask for selling the end-product after some time and you also might release the end-product in alpha and beta version BUT <br />  remember that all work must be uploaded and all credits will go to contributors [only GitHub names], administrators and the owner of this repository.

# Code Of Conduct (CoC)<br />
* You are not allowed to distribute this without the license and this README.md file.
## Why?! <br />
Because : <br />
1. It is illegal in all countries.
2. Sharing without permission to share is illegal and there are big consequences.
3. If they find you huge fines will apply and if it is repeated you are going to jail.

<br />
<br />

## Storyline of the game : <br />
Again, if you are interested in developing the game you shall be able to interprete graphics with C++ code and make any elements for the game.
I am only building the 'algorythm' and the dialogs of the game. If you think you can make better dialogs you are free to do it and upload it on GitHub.
<br />
### STORYLINE :
The storyline is a game that there will be cards with numbers. The user must sort the numbers. There will be challenges that the players must complete to go to the next level.
The challenges will be something like :
* Increasing order.
* Decreasing order.
* Whatever you think you would like to see in an educational game.
##### If : 
You think you should charge it you can since the GPU License does NOT restrict the end-user of selling the end-product.<bt />
## BUT <br />
There should be the GNU License found in this source and the source shall not be published by non-administrators.

# YOUR SIDE : <br /><br />
On your side you should be honest and cooperative because there will be many files.

### Also TRANSLATIONS are wanted because I will release the end-product in Greece and anyone who would like to spread the word [when the game is done] they can. Just make a translation to your language...
